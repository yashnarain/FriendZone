## Class & File Documentation
### GUI Structure
All the GUI classes are divided into several separate methods  and the ones below are common for most GUI classes.    
- `setLayoutManager()`     
	- this method is called from constructor to set the layout of the frame’s JPanel to null and change the background color using .decode() method of Color class.  
- `setLocationAndSize() `  
	- this method is called from constructor to set the location of various components like JButton, JLabel, comboBox, JTextArea, JList, etc. This method is responsible for the structure of GUI.  
- `addComponentsToContainer()`      
	- this method is called from constructor to add various components to the main JPanel of Jframe (called container or content depending on the class using the .add() method.  
- `addActionEvent()`  
	- this method is called from constructor to add Action Listeners for each user susceptible control like clicking on buttons, typing in text Area, and other user generated inputs.   
- `actionPerformed (ActionEvent e) `      
	- this method checks for the source of the input and performs a necessary action responding to it. Covered more down. 

### ChangePassword
- Allows the logged in user to change their password. User can update their password by selecting change password and confirming the new password by retyping it in the confirm password JTextField. It will display a JOptionPane success message if the password is updated successfully and an error message if the required fields are missing, the incorrect old password is put, mismatch between new password and confirm password.
	- **Method Description**  
		- `public void serverConnectionInitializer(Socket socket) throws: IOException`
			- sets the reader to a new BufferedReader and the writer to a new PrintWriter, also creates a socket for each.
		- `public void setLayoutManager()`
			- sets the layout to null
		- `public void setLocationAndSize()`
			- sets location, size, background color and font of the components 
		- `public void addComponentstoPanel()`
			- adds all components to the content pane
		- `public void addActionEvent()`
			- adds actionlisteners to the buttons
		- `public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)`
			- assigns actions to be performed on clicking each button
		- `public static void main(String[] args) throws: IOException`
			- creates the JFrame  
	- **Testing Description** 
		- **Valid input**
			- The user enters the current password in the first label, followed by the password they want to change it to in the next label. The new password is entered again correctly in the last label. Clicking update password changes the user’s password to the new one and the user can logout and login using it. If the current password is “a” and the new password is “b”, entering “a”, “b” and “b” and clicking on change password will update the password.

		- **Invalid input**
			- If the user enters their current password incorrectly, a dialog that says “Make sure you enter your old password correctly” pops up. If the password in the confirm password label does not match the new password, a dialog that says “make sure your new password and confirmed password matched” pops up. If any field is left blank, an error message prompting the user to fill all fields shows up and the blank label is highlighted in red. Entering only “a”, “b” will show an error dialog.

### CreateAccount
- Prompts the user for firstname, lastname, username and password. Provides 4 options for user to select from, in form of JButtons reset, create, exit, and back. The exit and back buttons have their usual meaning, reset button sets all the text fields which are entered by user to blank or empty strings. The show password checkbox allows user to hid (replace with “\*”) or show their password. The create account button shows a JOptionPane success message if the account is created successfully and an error message if the username is taken or the required fields are missing.

	- **Method Description**
		- `public void serverConnectionInitializer() throws: IOException`
			- sets the reader to a new BufferedReader and the writer to a new PrintWriter, also creates a socket for each.

		- `public static void main(String[] args) throws: IOException`
			- creates the JFrame
	- **Testing Description**
		- **Valid input**
			- The user enters the first name, last name, username and password of their choice. Clicking the create button creates an account with the entered credentials. The user is able to login using these credentials. Clicking on reset clears all text fields. Clicking on the checkbox below password text field shows the characters of the password, they are hidden otherwise. A valid input would be first name – “John”, last name – “Doe”,
		Username – “JDoe” and password - “jd123”.

### FriendList
- The friend list displays all the connected friends in a JList. This list only contains the existing friends or connected users. This does not include any users that have yet to accept the friend request. It has a scroll Pane to ensure that all friends of the user are viewable even if the maximum threshold value of 40 friends is reached.

### FriendRequests
- The requests are used to view sent and received friend requests. The window is divided into two main JPanels to show Received and Sent requests. The received requests sre the ones sent to the user. The user can select them and then select one of two options available Accept or Decline.  Once the user accepts, the user and the selected person become friends automatically, or if declined no connection take place. The user can view their already sent friend requests in the sent panel, where they have the option to cancel it. If the user is selected and the operation of cancelling, accepting and declining is a success a JOptionPane success message appears or an error message appears if no user is selected, mismatch between selected operation and the related Jbuttons. An example of this is when the user selects a sent request and tries to accept their own request.

### Manual Testing Documentation for Client-Server classes

	- We have included JUnit tests for return type, modifiers, and class existence.   

	- We are filtering the user input through the GUIs itself and therefore other methods will never receive invalid input. Therefore, the manual testing for the methods in ServerThread methods are documented.
	
	- All invalid user input is being filtered by the GUI itself, so there will be no case where invalid input can infiltrate the ServerThread class.
		- Logging in with invalid credentials will result in an error JOptionPane prompting the user to enter their correct credentials.
		- Logging in/ Creating an account when required fields are left empty will result in a JOptionPane pop-up prompting the user to enter all the details.
		- If a user tries creating an account with a username that has already been taken, then a pop-up message dialog will prompt the user to choose a different username.
		- Change password 
			- Checks are in place to validate the correct old password before the password has been updated. 
			- Checks are also in place to validate if both “new password” and “confirm password” fields have the same input from the user.
			- If the fields are empty, a message dialog will pop up to prompt the user to enter all the details.
		- Friend Requests
			- If a user tries rescinding a friend request that has already been accepted or declined by the receiving user, a message will be displayed informing the current user that the friend request has already been accepted or declined, depending on the situation.
			- If a user tries accepting or declining a friend request that had just been rescinded by the user who had sent that request, a message will be displayed informing the current user that the friend request had just been rescinded.
		- Delete Account
			- If a user deletes their account, and suppose another user is viewing their profile, an error message will pop up informing this other user that the current user’s account has been deleted, and subsequently the find friend’s drop down will be updated.
			- If a user deletes their account, all the current user’s friends’ friend lists will be updated, and any friend request sent by this user will be deleted.
